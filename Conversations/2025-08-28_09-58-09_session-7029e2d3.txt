[001] User: hello david

[002] AI: <think>
Okay, the user said "hello david". I need to respond appropriately. Let me check the available functions to see if any are needed here. The functions include things like getting status, checking memory, file operations, system commands, etc. But the user is just greeting me. There's no explicit request here. The best approach is to respond with a friendly greeting and offer assistance. No function calls are necessary at this point. I should keep it simple and welcoming.
