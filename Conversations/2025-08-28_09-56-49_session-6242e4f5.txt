[001] User: hello david

[002] AI: <think>
Okay, the user said "hello david". I need to respond appropriately. Let me check the available functions to see if any are needed here. The functions include things like getting status, checking memory, file operations, system commands, etc. But the user's message is just a greeting. There's no explicit request here. So maybe I don't need to call any functions. The best response is probably a friendly greeting. Let me make sure there's no hidden request. The user might just be testing or starting a conversation. So no function calls needed. Just reply with a hello.
