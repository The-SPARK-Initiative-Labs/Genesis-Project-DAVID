[001] User: delete test.txt

[002] AI: <think>
Okay, the user wants to delete a file called test.txt. Let me check the available tools. There's a function called delete_file which requires the path parameter. Since the user just said "delete test.txt", I assume the file is in the current working directory. So I should call delete_file with the path set to "test.txt". I need to make sure that the parameters are correctly formatted as JSON. No other parameters are needed here. Let me structure the tool call accordingly.

[003] AI: Successfully deleted C:\David\test.txt

[004] AI: <think>
Okay, the user wanted to delete test.txt, and the system responded that it successfully deleted C:\David\test.txt. So the deletion was successful. Now, I should confirm to the user that the file was deleted. Let me check if there's any specific information needed, but since the user just gave a simple command, a straightforward confirmation should be enough. I'll mention the file path that was deleted to be specific. Alright, time to let the user know it's done.

The file `test.txt` has been successfully deleted from the path `C:\David\test.txt`. Let me know if you need further assistance!
