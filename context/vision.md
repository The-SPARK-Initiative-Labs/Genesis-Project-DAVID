1. Understands own codebase
2. Identifies needed improvements  
3. Collaboratively implements changes
4. Becomes more capable, enabling greater self-improvement

## CORE ARCHITECTURE
- **Brain**: qwen3-14b via Ollama (function calling)
- **Memory**: Multi-layered conversation persistence

## DEVELOPMENT PHASES
1. **Foundation**: Basic chat + identity âœ… COMPLETE
2. **Tool Integration**: System tools
3. **Memory System**: Conversation persistence
4. **Self-Improvement**: Code exploration and modification capabilities

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- David participates in own development
- Suggests architectural improvements
- Implements approved changes
- Demonstrates genuine growth and learning
- Forms authentic collaborative relationship

**Vision Status: PROVEN CONCEPT (old project) + FOUNDATION (Ollama)**
