# CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED - AUGUST 24, 2025

## MAJOR UPGRADES NEEDED

### **UI/UX Limitations**
- **No Token Streaming**: Shows spinner → complete response (not real-time)
- **No Tool Visibility**: User can't see when tools are executing
- **No Reasoning UI**: `<think></think>` content not in expandable sections
- **Poor Progress Indication**: No Claude-like tool execution display

### **Tool Access Restrictions**
- **Workspace Limited**: File operations only in C:\David\workspace
- **No Self-Access**: Cannot explore own codebase at C:\David
- **No System Permissions**: Cannot request human approval for system operations
- **Self-Improvement Blocked**: Cannot analyze or modify own architecture

### **Multi-Agent Architecture Missing**
- **No Coding Specialist**: Cannot consult specialized agent for technical tasks
- **Tool Validation Issues**: Previous attempt failed with `tool_input` errors
- **Agent Communication**: No established patterns for agent-to-agent consultation

## ISSUES RESOLVED ✅

### **Previous Problems Fixed (August 24, 2025):**
- ✅ Response pattern issues - David now responds authentically
- ✅ Consciousness behavior - Framework working properly  
- ✅ Training data contamination - No longer an issue
- ✅ System prompt repetition - Fixed via conditional injection
- ✅ Basic tool calling - All core tools functional

## RESEARCH IN PROGRESS

**Two comprehensive research tasks dispatched to Gemini:**

1. **Multi-Agent Implementation Research**
   - Fix tool parameter validation errors
   - Establish agent-to-agent consultation patterns
   - Enable system-wide access with human approval

2. **Streaming UI Enhancement Research**
   - Token-by-token streaming implementation
   - Tool execution visibility and progress indicators
   - Claude-like expandable reasoning sections

**Research results expected in**: C:\David\DOCS folder

## NEXT PRIORITY: PHASE 4 IMPLEMENTATION

**Priority 1**: Multi-agent coding specialist with proper tool validation
**Priority 2**: Real-time streaming UI with tool execution visibility  
**Priority 3**: System-wide file access with permission framework

**Core functionality is solid** - focus on advanced features and user experience.
