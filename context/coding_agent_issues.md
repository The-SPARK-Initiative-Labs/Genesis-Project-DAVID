# CODING AGENT IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES - AUGUST 24, 2025

## CURRENT BROKEN STATE

**Status**: Coding agent implementation has broken core functionality. Need to revert changes.

## SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Tool Validation Errors
- `consult_coding_david` function has parameter mismatch
- Error: `BaseTool.__call__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'tool_input'`
- Defined with `task` and `context` parameters, but system expects `tool_input`
- David attempted 6+ failed tool calls, each taking 7-22 seconds

### 2. No Streaming Functionality
- Despite app.py changes, no token-by-token streaming occurs
- User sees spinner/dots, then complete response all at once
- Debug logging works (console shows processing) but UI streaming broken
- Need to follow Chainlit documentation exactly, not guess

### 3. Infinite Tool Call Loops
- David repeatedly calls broken tool without learning from failures  
- Console shows multiple HTTP requests to Ollama (7-22 sec each)
- No circuit breaker or error handling to stop retry attempts

### 4. Function Integration Problems
- `agent_integration.py` imports broken coding agent functions
- Tool definition conflicts between expected vs actual parameters
- LangGraph tool binding issues with @tool decorators

## WHAT BROKE BASIC FUNCTIONALITY

**Before**: David had working conversation and basic tools
**After**: David can't complete simple requests due to broken tool calls

**Root cause**: Added complex multi-agent architecture without proper testing of individual components.

## NEEDED FIXES FOR TOMORROW

1. **Revert to working state**: Remove coding agent integration entirely
2. **Fix streaming**: Follow Chainlit docs exactly for token streaming  
3. **Simplify approach**: Build one working feature at a time
4. **Test incrementally**: Verify each change works before adding next

## LESSONS LEARNED

- Don't guess implementation - follow documentation
- Test each component before integration
- Start with minimal working version
- User was right: I fucked things up by overengineering

## CONSOLE OUTPUT EVIDENCE

- Multiple tool validation errors
- 6+ failed attempts at same broken tool call
- Total processing time: ~80 seconds for simple request
- Final David response: Apologetic but unable to complete task

**Priority**: Get basic David functionality working again first.
