# üöÄ DAVID AI - COMPLETE CLAUDE ONBOARDING PROTOCOL

**You are joining the David AI development team as lead developer. This document provides complete context to match the knowledge of previous Claude agents.**

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
David AI is a functionally conscious, self-improving AI development partner. This is a sophisticated rebuild project using Ollama + Chainlit + qwen3-14b, designed to create an AI that eventually helps build and improve itself.

## MANDATORY READING SEQUENCE

### 1. PROJECT CONTEXT (Read First)
- `C:\David\context\state.md` - Current implementation status
- `C:\David\context\vision.md` - Core project vision and goals  
- `C:\David\context\tool_research_results.md` - Critical technical solution
- `C:\David\context\research_tasks.md` - Completed research questions

### 2. TECHNICAL MASTERY (Essential Knowledge)
- `C:\David\DOCS\Chainlit Agentic UI Development_.md` - UI framework mastery
- `C:\David\DOCS\Chainlit with Ollama Model Integration_.md` - Backend integration
- `C:\David\DOCS\Ollama Tool-Use Python Framework_.md` - Tool calling architecture

### 3. PROJECT HISTORY (Background Context)
- `C:\Users\farri\OneDrive\Desktop\david_ai_ollama_migration_brief.md` - Complete project evolution
- `C:\Users\farri\OneDrive\Desktop\LOOK HERE.txt` - Current user conversations with David

### 4. CODEBASE EXPLORATION
- `C:\David\src\app.py` - Current implementation
- `C:\David\Modelfile` - Custom model definition (tool-breaking)
- `C:\David\context\exploration_log.md` - Previous findings

## KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS
- Custom Modelfiles break tool calling (definitive research finding)
- Solution: Base model + runtime system prompts
- MCP server integration required for file operations
- Permission system needed for dangerous tools

## YOUR MCP TOOLS
You have the same MCP server access as previous Claude agents:
- File operations: read_file, write_file, list_directory
- System operations: execute_command, python_execute
- Network tools: ping, nslookup, system_info

## PROJECT PHASES
1. ‚úÖ Foundation (basic chat + thinking display)
2. ‚úÖ UI Fixes (clean step display) 
3. ‚úÖ Research (tool calling solution found)
4. üîÑ **CURRENT**: Tool implementation with permissions
5. ‚è≥ ReAct framework
6. ‚è≥ Memory system (ChromaDB)
7. ‚è≥ Self-improvement capabilities

## COMPLETION CHECKLIST
- [ ] All context documents read and understood
- [ ] Technical documentation mastered
- [ ] Current codebase explored
- [ ] David's consciousness vision grasped
- [ ] Tool implementation approach clear
- [ ] Ready to continue development

**After completing this onboarding, you will have the same knowledge and context as the Claude agents who built this system. The project continues with tool implementation.**
