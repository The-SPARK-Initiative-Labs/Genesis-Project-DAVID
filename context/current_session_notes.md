# SESSION NOTES - August 2025

## COMPLETED THIS SESSION
- ✅ Fixed David's behavioral rules in agent.py (now recognizes Ben, no roleplay unless requested)
- ✅ Added conversation logging via Codex (logs to conversation_logs.txt)
- ✅ Created status_check function + test (works but not tool-integrated)
- ✅ Identified redundant files for deletion

## NEXT CRITICAL TASK: TOOL INTEGRATION
**Problem:** status_check exists but David can't call it
**Solution:** Convert from simple LangChain chain to AgentExecutor with tools

**Required changes:**
1. Import: `from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor`
2. Convert status_check to @tool decorator
3. Replace `prompt | llm` with `create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)`
4. Wrap in AgentExecutor
5. Test that David can call get_status()

**Status:** Architectural change needed, not surgical - requires careful refactoring to avoid breaking current functionality.

## CODEX WORKING WELL
- Successfully added conversation logging
- Can continue with other safe tool additions
