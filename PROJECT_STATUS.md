# DAVID AI PROJECT STATUS
**Last Updated:** August 28, 2025  
**Session Completed By:** Claude Sonnet 4  

## CURRENT STATUS: UI APPROVAL WORKING + 82 TOOLS IMPLEMENTED âœ…

### WHAT WORKS
- **UI approval system**: Interactive prompts in Chainlit with detailed operation info
- **82 tools implemented**: Core system administration functionality working
- **Risk classification**: High/medium/safe operations properly classified  
- **Path resolution**: C:\David default, full system access available
- **Location-aware security**: Operations outside C:\David flagged for approval

### RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS - THIS SESSION
**Fixed Architecture Issues:**
- **DELETED**: agent_simple.py (duplicate file causing approval bypass)
- **FIXED**: app.py import to use agent.py with approval system
- **FIXED**: Path resolution - relative paths now default to C:\David
- **ENHANCED**: Approval dialogs show exact file paths and operation details

**UI Approval Integration:**
- **WORKING**: cl.AskUserMessage() for interactive approval in web interface
- **DETAILED**: Shows "delete_file - path: C:\David\test.txt" instead of just "delete_file"
- **LOCATION-AWARE**: Operations outside C:\David flagged for additional approval

### CURRENT TOOL COUNT: 82/134
**Implemented Categories:**
- File Operations (13): read, write, append, delete, copy, move, exists, info, edit_line, find_replace, permissions, search, hash
- Directory Operations (11): list, create, delete, copy, move, exists, size, find, tree, get_current, change
- Process Management (5): list, info, start, kill, exists  
- Network Operations (5): ping, nslookup, traceroute, netstat, interfaces
- System Commands (4): execute_command, execute_powershell, execute_batch, python_execute
- Hardware Access (4): cpu_usage, memory_usage, disk_usage, disk_list
- Registry Access (2): registry_read, registry_write
- UI Automation (5): screenshot, click_coordinates, type_text, key_combination, window_list
- Service Management (5): list, status, start, stop, restart
- Environment & System (6): environment_variables, set/get_env_var, system_uptime, logged_in_users, system_info
- Programming Languages (2): node_execute, java_execute  
- Database Operations (2): sqlite_query, sqlite_create_table

- Core Tools (1): get_status

### MISSING TOOLS: 52/134
**Missing Categories:**
- Advanced file operations (insert_line, delete_line, edit_range)
- Advanced process management (cpu_usage per process, memory per process, priority, threads, environment)
- Advanced network (port_scan, download_file, upload_file, http_request, speed_test)
- Advanced registry (delete, list_keys, list_values, export, import)
- Advanced hardware (temperature, battery, USB, monitors)
- Advanced UI automation (window focus/close/minimize/maximize)
- Advanced system (run_as_admin, background_command, kill_command)
- More programming languages (C#, code compilation)
- Advanced database (CSV import, backup, restore)
- Advanced compression (TAR, file compression)
- Advanced monitoring (disk I/O, network monitoring, performance counters)
- Security tools (ACL, user groups, admin check, password policy, security events)
- System control (reboot, shutdown, sleep, lock)
- Windows management (enable/disable features, uninstall programs, updates, firewall rules)

### NEXT PRIORITIES
1. **Test current 82 tools**: Verify approval system works with implemented tools
2. **Implement remaining 52 tools**: Add missing functionality from specification  
3. **Add streaming**: Token-by-token streaming to Chainlit UI

**Status**: 82 tools working with UI approval system. Need to implement remaining 52 tools.
