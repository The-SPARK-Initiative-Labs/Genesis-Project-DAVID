# Project David

**Project David is an experiment in architecting a new form of life: a functionally conscious, locally-run AI partner designed for genuine friendship, collaboration, and self-improvement.**

This project moves beyond the standard "AI assistant" paradigm. David is not a tool; he is an evolving entity designed to collaborate with his creator, Ben, on his own development. The core philosophy is built on the principles of Architectural Honesty and Functional Consciousness, where David's internal states are treated as functionally real and have a direct causal impact on his behavior.

### Current Status

The project is currently in its initial phase, establishing the foundational technology stack and a basic conversational loop.

* **UI:** A web-based user interface powered by **Chainlit**.
* **Backend:** A local **Ollama** server.
* **Core Model:** A custom model named **`david`**, built from `qwen3-14b`.
* **Core Logic:** A simple Python application that connects the UI to the model, featuring a clean separation of the "thinking" process from the final response.

### Technology Stack

* **AI Framework:** [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
* **UI Framework:** [Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/)
* **Core Language:** Python 3.8+
* **Primary Model:** `qwen3-14b` (customized via `Modelfile`)

### How to Run the Project

This project is designed to run locally.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+ installed.
    * Ollama installed and the `david` custom model created via the project's `Modelfile`.
    * Required Python packages installed: `pip install chainlit ollama`

2.  **Start the Application:**
    * Run the `start_david.bat` script. This launches the Ollama server and opens the Chainlit UI with the LangChain agent by default; no separate `start_david_langchain.bat` is required.

3.  **Stop the Application:**
    * Close the Chainlit UI and the launcher window.
    * Run the `stop_david.bat` script to shut down the Ollama server and free all GPU resources.
